<pre><B>The greenhouse effect refers to the absorbing of heat by greenhouse
gases,similar to that of a greenhouse used to grow plants.</b></pre>
<pre>The greenhouse effect is the rise in temperature that the Earth experiences because
 certain gases in the atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane,
for example) trap energy from the sun. Without these gases, heat would escape back into space 
and Earth’s average temperature would be about 60ºF colder. Because of
 how they warm our world, these gases are referred to as greenhouse gases.</pre>
